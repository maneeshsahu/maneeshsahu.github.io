KQED has an interesting post about strategies for winning the SFUSD lottery - [S.F.’s Kindergarten Lottery: Do Parents’ Tricks Work?] (https://ww2.kqed.org/news/2018/01/10/s-f-s-kindergarten-lottery-do-parents-tricks-work/). It has a visualization that lists the enrollments by school.

What is missing is the impact of a school selection in the different choices and the potential assignment. The visualization below has the breakdown for the first 20 choices in an application.
