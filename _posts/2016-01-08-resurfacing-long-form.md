  Introduction.

It has been 5 years since I switched from blogging to micro-blogging. Turns out, Microblogging has me hardly writing anymore. On Twitter, I am frequently re-tweeting and favoriting; while  on Facebook, I am mostly posting pictures. When I look at my old blog posts, I am reminded of a time when I wrote like no one was reading...and if someone read at all, it was because someone actually took the initiative to read my posts by visiting my blog. Just like the slow cooking movement, I forsee a return back to the longform in writing. My blog hopes to rekindle some of the old magic.
