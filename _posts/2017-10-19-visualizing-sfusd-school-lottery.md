Every year, SF Parents of kindergarten-aged children participate in what is commonly referred to as the SFUSD School Lottery. Roughly 5000 children vying for 4000 seats spread across 125 schools. To complicate things a bit, some schools are more popular than others. Clarendon Elementary School had nearly 1600 applicants for 44 seats. SFUSD also has tie-breaker rules, so kids dont necessarily get first dibs at local attendance area schools.

I created this visualization in Tableau using data from SFUSD and  crowd-sourced data created by members of a Facebook group called the 'SFUSD 2018/19 Support Group'.
